# NEDI-Negative-Event-Density-Index
The Negative Event Density Index (NEDI) is a digital humanities tool developed to quantify historical volatility. By scraping Wikipedia’s chronological archives, it clusters events like conflicts and economic crises into a "density" score. It offers a macro-level view of global turmoil via interactive charts and data exports.
